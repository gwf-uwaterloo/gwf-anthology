%X Fluoride boosts the oxidase-like activity of hydrolyzed Ce(\textlesssc\textgreateriv\textless/sc\textgreater) but inhibits the activity of Ce(\textlesssc\textgreateriv\textless/sc\textgreater), allowing intentional hydrolysis to be performed for consistent analysis of Ce(\textlesssc\textgreateriv\textless/sc\textgreater).
