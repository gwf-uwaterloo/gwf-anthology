    abstract = "The combination of photocatalysis and biodegradation was investigated for the removal of nine selected pharmaceuticals as a means to reduce loadings into the environment. The combined process, consisting of a resource-efficient mild photocatalysis and a subsequent biological treatment, was compared to single processes of intensive photocatalysis and biological treatment. The UV-TiO2 based photocatalysis effectively removed atorvastatin, atenolol and fluoxetine ({\textgreater}80{\%}). Biological treatment after mild photocatalytic pretreatment removed diclofenac effectively ({\textgreater}99{\%}), while it persisted during the single biological treatment (",
