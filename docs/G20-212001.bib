    abstract = "[Extract] The Brazilian Amazon{---}the largest tropical rainforest in the world{---}has reached its highest level of deforestation since 2008 (Display footnote number:1). In 2019, 10,897 km2 of land were deforested, a 50.7{\%} jump over the previous year (Display footnote number:1). A combination of threats, including tens of thousands of forest fires (Display footnote number:2), expanding road networks (Display footnote number:3, 4), weakened environmental laws (Display footnote number:5, 6), and a failure to enforce environmental laws and regulations (Display footnote number:6), is responsible. Given the staunchly pro-development policies of Brazil{'}s current government, a coalition of key actors in the financial sector is needed to help protect the embattled Amazon rainforest.",
