    abstract = "Given an m{\mbox{$\times$}}n table T of positive weights, and a rectangle R with an area equal to the sum of the weights, a table cartogram computes a partition of R into m{\mbox{$\times$}}n convex quadrilateral faces such that each face has the same adjacencies as its corresponding cell in T, and has an area equal to the cell{'}s weight. In this paper, we examine constraint optimization-based and physics-inspired cartographic transformation approaches to produce cartograms for large tables with thousands of cells. We show that large table cartograms may provide diagrammatic representations in various real-life scenarios, e.g., for analyzing correlations between geospatial variables and creating visual effects in images. Our experiments with real-life datasets provide insights into how one approach may outperform the other in various application contexts.",
