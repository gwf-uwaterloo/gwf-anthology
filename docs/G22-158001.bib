    abstract = "Abstract Reliable, long-term records of glacier mass change are invaluable to the glaciological and climate-change communities and used to assess the importance of glacier wastage on streamflow. Here we evaluate the in-situ observations of glacier mass change for Place (1982{--}2020) and Peyto glaciers (1983{--}2020) in western Canada. We use geodetic mass balance to calibrate a physically-based mass-balance model coupled with an ice dynamics routine. We find large discrepancies between the glaciological and geodetic records for the periods 1987{--}1993 (Place) and 2001{--}2006 (Peyto). Over the period of observations, the exclusion of ice dynamics in the model increased simulated cumulative mass change by {\textasciitilde}10.6 (24{\%}) and 7.1 (21{\%}) m w.e. for Place and Peyto glacier, respectively. Cumulative mass loss using geodetic, modelled and glaciological approaches are respectively − 30.5 {\mbox{$\pm$}} 4.5, − 32.0 {\mbox{$\pm$}} 3.6, − 29.7 {\mbox{$\pm$}} 3.6 m w.e. for Peyto Glacier (1982{--}2017) and − 45.9 {\mbox{$\pm$}} 5.2, − 43.1 {\mbox{$\pm$}} 3.1, − 38.4 {\mbox{$\pm$}} 5.1 m w.e. for Place Glacier (1981{--}2019). Based on discrepancies noted in the mass-balance records for certain decades (e.g. 1990s), we caution the community if these data are to be used for hydrological model development.",
