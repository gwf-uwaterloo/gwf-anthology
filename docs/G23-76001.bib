    abstract = "Abstract Temperatures near 0{\mbox{$^\circ$}}C represent a critical threshold for many environmental processes and socio‐economic activities. This study examines surface air temperatures ( T ) near 0{\mbox{$^\circ$}}C (−2{\mbox{$^\circ$}}C {\mbox{$\leq$}} T {\mbox{$\leq$}} 2{\mbox{$^\circ$}}C) across much of southern Canada over a 13 year period (October 2000{--}September 2013). It utilized hourly data from 39 weather stations and from 4‐km resolution Weather Research and Forecasting model simulations that were both a retrospective simulation as well as a pseudo‐global warming simulation applicable near the end of the 21st century. Average annual occurrences of near‐0{\mbox{$^\circ$}}C conditions increase by a relatively small amount of 5.1{\%} from 985 hr in the current climate to 1,035 hr within the future one. Near‐0{\mbox{$^\circ$}}C occurrences with precipitation vary from {\textless}5{\%} to approximately 50{\%} of these values. Near‐0{\mbox{$^\circ$}}C occurrences are sometimes higher than values of neighboring temperatures. These near‐0{\mbox{$^\circ$}}C peaks in temperature distributions can occur in both the current and future climate, in only one, or in neither. Only 4.3{\%} of southern Canada is not associated with a near‐0{\mbox{$^\circ$}}C peak and 65.8{\%} is associated with a near‐0{\mbox{$^\circ$}}C peak in both climates. It is inferred that latent heat exchanges from the melting and freezing of, for example, precipitation and the snowpack contribute significantly to some of these findings.",
