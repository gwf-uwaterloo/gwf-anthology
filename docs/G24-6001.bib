    abstract = "Version 2.1 of Environment and Climate Change Canada's Canadian Surface Reanalysis (CaSR), based on the Regional Deterministic Reforecast System (RDRS), was implemented in 2022 to provide temporally complete meteorological data over 1980{--}2018 covering Canada at 10 km spatial resolution. Similarly, the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis-Land (ERA5-Land) dataset at ∼9 km spatial resolution became available. To assess their performance in complex topography, this paper undertakes spatiotemporal inter-comparisons between the RDRS and ERA5-Land reanalysis products with station-based data across British Columbia's Skeena and Nechako watersheds for 1980{--}2018. Results reveal persistent cold biases, ranging from −6.2{\mbox{$^\circ$}}C to −1.6{\mbox{$^\circ$}}C basin-wide, in reanalysis mean annual air temperatures relative to observations, but biases vary in both space and time. Conversely, reanalysis total annual precipitation shows wet biases, ranging from 25{\%} to 59{\%} basin-wide. Analyses generally show wetting trends for observations and ERA5-Land while RDRS exhibits drying trends. Reanalysis datasets achieve better agreement overall with observations over the Nechako Watershed, likely due to its denser network of meteorological stations and less complex terrain than the Skeena Watershed. Despite some deficiencies, the RDRS and ERA5-Land reanalyses remain particularly useful products to assess regional climate variability and climatic change given their generally skilful representation of spatial patterns and temporal trends in meteorological variables across the Nechako and Skeena watersheds.",
