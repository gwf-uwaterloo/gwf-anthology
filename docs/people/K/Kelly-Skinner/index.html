These chemicals have been produced for commercial use (PCBs) or unintentionally as by-products of industry or natural processes (PCBs, dioxins, and furans). Additionally, dioxin-like PCBs were formerly used in electrical applications before being banned internationally (2004). These chemicals are widely dispersed in the environment as they can contaminate air and travel hundreds to thousands of kilometers before depositing on land or water, thereafter, potentially entering food chains. Community concerns surrounding the safety of traditional foods prompted a human biomonitoring project in Old Crow, Yukon Territory (YT), Canada (2019). Through collaborative community engagement, dioxins and like compounds were identified as a priority for exposure assessment from biobanked samples. In 2022, biobanked plasma samples (n = 54) collected in Old Crow were used to measure exposures to seven dioxins, ten furans, and four dioxin-like PCBs. 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDD, 1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDD, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD, OCDD, 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDF, PCB 126, and PCB 169 were detected in at least 50 % of samples. Among these analytes, the only congener at elevated levels was PCB 169, which was approximately ‚àº2-fold higher than the general population of Canada. No significant sex-based or body mass index (BMI) differences in biomarker concentrations were observed. Generally, the concentrations of the detected congeners increased with age, except for 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD. For the first time, this research measures dioxin and like-compound exposures in Old Crow, advancing the information available on chemical exposures in the Arctic. Further research could be directed towards the investigation of PCB 169 exposure sources and temporal monitoring of exposures and determinants.</div></div><div data-prj=prj31><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://www.doi.org/10.1139/er-2024-0011 data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Publisher's Website" target=_blank>DOI

However, the toxicity of arsenic to consumers strongly depends on the chemical forms, or species, present. Risk assessments often rely on total arsenic concentrations ([As]), adjusting for assumed small percentages of the most harmful inorganic species. While studies on arsenic speciation in marine fish are widespread, and commonly report less toxic arsenobetaine (AsB) as the dominant form, fewer studies have been conducted on freshwater fish, where arsenic speciation may be more variable. To assess these findings, we conducted a systematic literature review on arsenic speciation in freshwater fish using Covidence¬© review management software. From over 1100 screened studies, 41 were selected for inclusion based on predefined criteria. These studies reported highly variable arsenic speciation patterns in freshwater fish, calling into question the assumption that AsB is the dominant form present. Sites with suspected or known arsenic contamination issues were prominent, with >50% of data reviewed originating from a contaminated river or lake, but the effect of contamination on arsenic speciation was variable. Although AsB and other organic forms typically dominated, some studies (6/41; 15%) identified fish with elevated concentrations of inorganic arsenic (>1 mg/kg dry wt.), most often corresponding to over 20% of total arsenic. Furthermore, arsenic speciation results accounted for a highly variable proportion of total [As] in fish, often less than 50%. Assuming 20% inorganic arsenic appears to be a poor approximation that cannot be applied to all fish. Based on this considerable variability, we recommend the direct measurement of arsenic species whenever possible, especially when total [As] is elevated above relevant guidelines for the most toxic species (e.g., 0.1-2 mg/kg inorganic arsenic wet wt.). We also recommend future works communicate their results in more detail, including complete description of QAQC protocols, to improve the potential for future meta-analyses. Additional work is needed to characterize arsenic speciation in freshwater fish and assess the toxicity of various arsenic species to accurately evaluate the environmental and human health risks associated with arsenic in fish.</div></div><div data-prj=prj31><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169205 data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Publisher's Website" target=_blank>DOI

This study aims to identify possible local determinants of levels of these parameters, including consumption of locally harvested traditional foods, lifestyle factors, and demographics, in Old Crow and, for comparison, two other northern populations: communities in the Dehcho and Saht√∫ regions of the Northwest Territories. We ran generalized linear models to identify possible associations between individual determinants of exposure and key biomarkers, controlling for age and sex. In Old Crow, several variables were associated with elevated exposure levels of these biomarkers, including drinking untreated river water (29% higher blood manganese levels and 120% higher blood lead levels), eating caribou kidneys (22% higher blood manganese levels and 58% higher blood lead levels), and eating whitefish (28% higher blood cobalt levels). Additionally, in order to differentiate results in Old Crow from those in other northern regions and to identify trends across regions, we observed relationships between consumption of moose and caribou organs and lead and hexachlorobenzene levels in the reference populations and pooled population groups. Though levels of particular contaminants may be elevated in some traditional foods, these foods remain an important source of nutrients for members in these communities and provide other benefits, including increased physical activity through harvesting, mental health improvements, and spiritual wellness.</div></div><div data-prj=prj31><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://www.doi.org/10.1080/22423982.2023.2208810 data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Publisher's Website" target=_blank>DOI

We aimed to identify potential lead sources and pathways of lead exposure, including long-range transport, and the magnitude of exposure in Arctic and subarctic communities. A scoping review strategy and screening approach was used to search literature from January 2000 to December 2020. A total of 228 academic and grey literature references were synthesised. The majority of these studies (54%) were from Canada. Indigenous people in Arctic and subarctic communities in Canada had higher levels of lead than the rest of Canada. The majority of studies in all Arctic countries reported at least some individuals above the level of concern. Lead levels were influenced by a number of factors including using lead ammunition to harvest traditional food and living in close proximity to mines. Lead levels in water, soil, and sediment were generally low. Literature showed the possibility of long-range transport via migratory birds. Household lead sources included lead-based paint, dust, or tap water. This literature review will help to inform management strategies for communities, researchers, and governments, with the aim of decreasing lead exposure in northern regions.</div></div><div data-prj=prj31><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://www.doi.org/10.1111/cag.12872 data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Publisher's Website" target=_blank>DOI

A secondary aim assessed the extent to which traditional food was offered through the identified programs, which has implications for cultural appropriateness and, in turn, food sovereignty. Peer‚Äêreviewed articles and grey literature published between 2000 and 2022 were examined. Frameworks to guide methodologies include PRISMA‚ÄêScR, Arksey and O'Malley, Levac et al., and Godin et al.'s grey literature search strategy. Inclusion criteria were food programs located north of the Northern Boundary Line, programs providing food access, and programs serving Indigenous communities. Data were synthesized based on program type, target population, and whether the program offered or incorporated traditional food. The review yielded 30 records wherein 46 unique food programs were identified and characterized into eight distinct program types. Program success of the identified programs depended on funding availability and continuity, staff/volunteer availability and retention (including program champions), and types of policies that impact traditional food provision. Findings are valuable to organizations and communities interested in using food programs to support Indigenous food security and sovereignty efforts.</div></div><h4>2022</h4><div data-prj=prj28><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://www.doi.org/10.1139/facets-2021-0094 data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Publisher's Website" target=_blank>DOI

A research study was completed to characterize the consumption of water and beverages prepared with water and identify the perception of water consumption in Indigenous communities from the Northwest Territories and Yukon, Canada. As part of a larger research program, data for this study were available from a 24-hour recall dietary survey ( n = 162), a health messages survey ( n = 150), and an exposure factor survey ( n = 63). A focus group was conducted with Elders in an on-the-land camp setting. The consumption of water-based beverages in winter was 0.9 L/day on average, mainly consisting of tea and coffee. Of the 81% of respondents who reported consuming water-based beverages in the previous 24 hours of the survey, 33% drank more bottled water than tap water. About 2% of respondents consumed water from the land (during the winter season). Chlorine smell was the main limiting factor reported to the consumption of tap water. Results from the focus group indicated that Indigenous knowledge might impact both the perception and consumption of water.

These foods can be particularly difficult to access for those living in urban environments. We ask: what policies are involved in the regulation of traditional/country foods and how do these policies affect access to traditional/country food for Indigenous Peoples living in urban centers? Which policies act as barriers? This paper provides a comparative policy analysis of wild food policies across Ontario, the Northwest Territories (NWT), and the Yukon Territory, Canada, by examining and making comparisons between various pieces of legislation, such as fish and wildlife acts, hunting regulations, food premises legislation, and meat inspection regulations. We provide examples of how some programs serving Indigenous Peoples have managed to provide wild foods, using creative ways to operate within the existing system. While there is overwhelming evidence that traditional/country food plays a critical role for the health and well-being of Indigenous Peoples within Canada, Indigenous food systems are often undermined by provincial and territorial wild food policies. Provinces like Ontario with more restrictive policies may be able to learn from the policies in the Territories. We found that on a system level, there are significant constraints on the accessibility of wild foods in urban spaces because the regulatory food environment is designed to manage a colonial market-based system that devalues Indigenous values of sharing and reciprocity and Indigenous food systems, particularly for traditional/country foods. Dismantling the barriers to traditional/country food access in that system can be an important way forward.</div></div><div data-prj=prj28><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://www.doi.org/10.3390/nu14020378 data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Publisher's Website" target=_blank>DOI

The main aim of the present study is to describe dietary intakes for macronutrients and micronutrients in traditional and market food from the Mackenzie Valley study. We also show the trends of contributions and differences of dietary intakes over time from 1994 data collected and reported by the Centre for Indigenous People's Nutrition and Environment (CINE) in 1996. Based on 24-h dietary recall data, the study uses descriptive statistics to describe the observed dietary intake of the Dene First Nations communities in the Dehcho and Saht√∫ regions of the NWT. Indigenous people in Canada, like the sub-Arctic regions of Dehcho and Saht√∫ of the NWT, continue to consume traditional foods, although as a small percentage of their total dietary intake. The observed dietary intake calls for action to ensure that traditional food remains a staple as it is critical for the wellbeing of Dene in the Dehcho and Saht√∫ regions and across the territory.</div></div><div data-prj=prj28><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://www.doi.org/10.3390/nu14091915 data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Publisher's Website" target=_blank>DOI

A community researcher in Tuktoyaktuk conducted storytelling interviews with country food knowledge holders (n = 7) and community members (n = 3), and a talking circle with local public health dietary message disseminators (n = 2) in June-July 2021. The lead author conducted key informant telephone and videoconference interviews with territorial and regional dietary message disseminators (n = 5) in June 2021. Interviews were coded and analyzed thematically. Our findings indicate that participants at all levels support increased inclusion of cultural and community perspectives about food to develop regionally and locally tailored dietary messaging. While most dietary message stakeholders wish to be involved in co-development processes, some country food knowledge holders in Tuktoyaktuk expressed a desire to lead local communications about country foods. Informed by participants' experiences and needs, we provide recommendations for future community-led approaches to further (co-)develop and communicate effective, culturally meaningful dietary messaging that promotes Inuvialuit food sovereignty.</div></div><h4>2021</h4><div data-prj=prj28><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143339 data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Publisher's Website" target=_blank>DOI

Markets like the Yellowknife Farmers Market (YKFM) are social spaces that support local food, yet the COVID-19 pandemic has forced changes to their current model. We explore the potential of online marketplaces to contribute to a resilient, sustainable food system through a case study of the YKFM. Methods In 2019, a collaborative mixed-method evaluation was initiated by the YKFM and university partners in the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. The evaluation included an in-person Rapid Market Assessment dot survey and questionnaire of market patrons from two YKFM dates prior to the pandemic. Due to COVID-19, a vendor survey and interviews were deferred. Data collected from the two patron surveys, alongside researcher observations, available literature, public announcements, and informal email and phone discussions, inform the discussion. Results For the patron surveys, 59 dot survey and 31 questionnaire participants were recruited. The top motivators for attendance were eating dinner, atmosphere, and supporting local businesses, and most patrons attended as couples and spent over half of their time talking to others. The YKFM did not move online; instead, they proposed and implemented a ‚ÄúShop, don‚Äôt stop‚Äù market. Informal conversations suggested the small scale of the market and technology challenges were perceived barriers to moving online. The physically-distanced market was well-attended and featured in local media. Conclusions NWT food strategies rely on farmers markets to nurture a local food system. Data suggest a potential incongruence between an online model and important market characteristics such as the event-like atmosphere. Available literature suggests online markets can support local food by facilitating purchasing and knowledge-sharing, yet they do not replicate the open-air or social experience. The decision not to move online for the YKFM reflects market patron characteristics and current food context in Yellowknife and the NWT. While online adaptation does not fit into the YKFM plan today, online markets may prove useful as a complementary strategy for future emerging stressors to enhance the resiliency of local systems.</div></div><div data-prj=prj28><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12937-021-00664-x data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Publisher's Website" target=_blank>DOI

The objective of this project was to document the consumption of game birds for Dene First Nations in the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. Design: Participants were invited to complete a FFQ using an iPad to document the types of country foods consumed, as well as consumption frequency and preparation methods, including thirteen types of game birds. Setting: The project was implemented in nine communities in the Dehcho and Saht√∫ regions of the NWT, Canada. Participants: A total of 237 children and adult participants from Dene First Nations in the Mackenzie Valley region of the NWT took part in the current study. Results: FFQ findings indicated that game birds were frequently consumed in both Dehcho and Saht√∫ communities. Canada goose and mallard were found to be consumed by the largest number of participants. Five different species (including Canada goose and mallard) were found to be consumed by at least 25 % of participants over the last year. When consuming game birds, most participants reported consuming the meat as well as most, if not all, other parts of the bird. Conclusions: Differences were observed since the last country food assessment in the 1990s in the same regions. These findings increase knowledge of the current Dene diet patterns and support the understanding of diet transition.</div></div><div data-prj=prj28><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://www.doi.org/10.1017/s1368980021000021 data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Publisher's Website" target=_blank>DOI

The objective of this project was to document the consumption of game birds for Dene First Nations in the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. Design: Participants were invited to complete a FFQ using an iPad to document the types of country foods consumed, as well as consumption frequency and preparation methods, including thirteen types of game birds. Setting: The project was implemented in nine communities in the Dehcho and Saht√∫ regions of the NWT, Canada. Participants: A total of 237 children and adult participants from Dene First Nations in the Mackenzie Valley region of the NWT took part in the current study. Results: FFQ findings indicated that game birds were frequently consumed in both Dehcho and Saht√∫ communities. Canada goose and mallard were found to be consumed by the largest number of participants. Five different species (including Canada goose and mallard) were found to be consumed by at least 25 % of participants over the last year. When consuming game birds, most participants reported consuming the meat as well as most, if not all, other parts of the bird. Conclusions: Differences were observed since the last country food assessment in the 1990s in the same regions. These findings increase knowledge of the current Dene diet patterns and support the understanding of diet transition.</div></div><h4>2020</h4><div data-prj=prj28><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://www.doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-40591/v1 data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Publisher's Website" target=_blank>DOI

Markets like the Yellowknife Farmers Market (YKFM) are social spaces that support local food, yet the COVID-19 pandemic has forced changes to their current model. This paper explores the potential of online marketplaces to contribute to a resilient, sustainable food system and the barriers to making this transition for the YKFM. Methods In 2019, a collaborative mixed-method evaluation was initiated by the YKFM and university partners in the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. The co-created evaluation plan included two patron surveys, a vendor survey and vendor interviews. The evaluation began with an in-person Rapid Market Assessment dot survey and questionnaire of market patrons from two YKFM dates prior to the pandemic. Due to COVID-19, we determined it was not a good time to conduct the vendor survey and interviews. Ongoing engagement with the market facilitated an assessment of the COVID-19 response. Results For the patron surveys, 59 dot survey and 31 questionnaire participants were recruited. The top motivators for attendance were eating dinner, atmosphere, and supporting local businesses, and most patrons attended as couples and spent over half of their time talking to others. The YKFM did not move online, citing concerns about meeting produce demand, incongruence between the online model and market strengths, low dependency on the YKFM by vendors, and potential challenges for patrons using new technology. Conclusions NWT food strategies rely on farmers‚Äô markets to nurture a local food system. Online markets can support local food by facilitating purchases and knowledge-sharing, yet they do not replicate the open-air or social experience. Challenges to the online transition reflect the survey findings and current food context in the NWT. While online adaptation does not fit into the YKFM plan today, online markets may prove useful as a complementary strategy for future emerging stressors to enhance the resiliency of local systems.</div></div><div data-prj=prj28><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://www.doi.org/10.1017/s1368980020002402 data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Publisher's Website" target=_blank>DOI

Eligibility criteria included all full-text articles of any design reporting on research on food consumption, nutrient intake, dietary adequacy, dietary change, food security, nutrition-related chronic diseases or traditional food harvesting and consumption among Inuit populations residing in Canada. Articles reporting on in vivo and in vitro experiments or on health impacts of environmental contaminants were excluded.A total of 162 studies were included. Studies indicated declining country food (CF) consumption in favour of market food (MF). Drivers of this transition include colonial processes, poverty and socio-economic factors, changing food preferences and knowledge, and climate change. Health implications of the dietary transition are complex. Micro-nutrient deficiencies and dietary inadequacy are serious concerns and likely exacerbated by increased consumption of non-nutrient dense MF. Food insecurity, overweight, obesity and related cardiometabolic health outcomes are growing public health concerns. Meanwhile, declining CF consumption is entangled with shifting culture and traditional knowledge, with potential implications for psychological, spiritual, social and cultural health and well-being.By exploring and synthesising published literature, this review provides insight into the complex factors influencing Inuit diet and health. Findings may be informative for future research, decision-making and intersectoral actions around risk assessment, food policy and innovative community programmes.</div></div><div data-prj=prj28><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://www.doi.org/10.1080/22423982.2020.1760071 data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Publisher's Website" target=_blank>DOI

Through an examination of the current state of food systems infrastructure, transportation, harvest, and production in the Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Nunavik, and Nunatsiavut, we argue in favour of a multi-sector approach that supports diversified food systems, including traditional/country food production and distribution, in a way that values and prioritizes community-led initiatives and Indigenous peoples‚Äô self-determination and self-governance. The challenge of developing sustainable, northern food systems requires made-in-the-North solutions that are attuned to cultural, geographic, environmental, and political contexts. Recent policy developments suggest some progress in this direction, however much more work is needed. Ultimately, sustainable northern food systems must be defined by and for Northerners at community, local, and regional levels, with particular attention paid to treaty rights and the right to self-determination of First Nations and other Indigenous communities.</div></div><h4>2018</h4><div data-prj=prj28><p class="d-sm-flex align-items-stretch"><span class="d-block mr-2 text-nowrap list-button-row"><a class="badge badge-primary align-middle mr-1" href=https://www.doi.org/10.1080/22423982.2018.1510714 data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Publisher's Website" target=_blank>DOI

Country foods (locally harvested fish, game birds, land animals and plants), which contribute to improved food security, can also be a primary route of contaminant exposure among populations in remote regions. A community-based project was launched in the Dehcho and Saht√π regions of the Northwest Territories (Canada) to: 1) assess contaminants exposure and nutrition status; 2) investigate the role of country food on nutrient and contaminant levels and 3) understand the determinants of message perception on this issue. Consultation with community members, leadership, local partners and researchers was essential to refine the design of the project and implement it in a culturally relevant way. This article details the design of a community-based biomonitoring study that investigates country food use, contaminant exposure and nutritional status in Canadian subarctic First Nations in the Dehcho and Saht√π regions. Results will support environmental health policies in the future for these communities.

In communities where country foods (locally harvested foods: land animals, fish, birds, plants) are integrated in the daily diet, as is the case in remote northern regions where food security is a challenge, such foods can potentially be a significant route of contaminant exposure. To assess this issue, a biomonitoring project was implemented among Dene/M√©tis communities of the Dehcho region of the Northwest Territories, Canada.Participants completed dietary surveys (i.e., a food frequency questionnaire and 24-h recall) to estimate food consumption patterns as well as a Health Messages Survey to evaluate the awareness and perception of contaminants and consumption notices. Biological sampling of hair, urine and blood was conducted. Toxic metals (e.g., mercury, lead, cadmium), essential metals (e.g., copper, nickel, zinc), fatty acids, and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were measured in samples.The levels of contaminants in blood, hair and urine for the majority of participants were below the available guidance values for mercury, cadmium, lead and uranium. However, from the 279 participants, approximately 2% were invited to provide follow up samples, mainly for elevated mercury level. Also, at the population level, blood lead (GM: 11 Œºg/L) and blood cadmium (GM: 0.53 Œºg/L) were slightly above the Canadian Health Measures Survey data. Therefore, although country foods occasionally contain elevated levels of particular contaminants, human exposures to these metals remained similar to those seen in the Canadian general population. In addition, dietary data showed the importance and diversity of country foods across participating communities, with the consumption of an average of 5.1% of total calories from wild-harvested country foods.This project completed in the Mackenzie Valley of the Northwest Territories fills a data gap across other biomonitoring studies in Canada as it integrates community results, will support stakeholders in the development of public health strategies, and will inform environmental health issue prioritization.</div></div></div><div class=col-lg-3><a class="btn btn-lg btn-secondary btn-block mb-2" href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/search?q=Kelly+Skinner" title="Search for 'Kelly Skinner' on Semantic Scholar"><i class="ai ai-semantic-scholar"></i><span class=pl-sm-2>Search</span></a><div class=row><div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-12"><div class=card><h5 class=card-header>Co-authors</h5><ul class="list-group list-group-flush list-group-compact"><li class=list-group-item><a href=/gwf-publications/people/B/Brian-Laird/ class=align-middle data-uni=uni0002>Brian Laird</a>
